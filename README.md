## Previous Experience
A highly motivated and results-driven Machine Learning and Data Science Engineer with over 2 years of intern/Part-time experience in various roles, including ML Research Intern at World Resources Institute, BISAG(N), Android Developer at USC CSI-Cancer research, SDE at GRE Electronics Pvt. Ltd., and Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. LTD.

I have interned with organizations like Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-Informatics (BISAG-N), Govt. of India as a Researcher, where I worked on Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms to result in Buildings and Road Detection for Urban & Rural Area Development with Open-Source Data of Satellite Imagery, which integrated the two concepts together of CNN and GIS from their advantages over traditional classifiers and remote sensing techniques and goes on to implementing deep learning models and change detection after detection of Buildings and Roads in a particular Dataset and later assess the change in the span of the period and giving the analysis of the output. I also interned at GRE Electronics Pvt. Ltd for SOLAR Innovations for Everyday Life research, Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd., and West Coast Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. as Data-Base Management, ERP Software, and E-commerce Business Intern.

I've handled various responsibilities in my previous intern, college, and international positions and quickly established talents in prioritizing tasks, meeting deadlines, and finding solutions to eliminate obstacles. I currently work part-time as a Technical Assistant for USC Information Technology Services.

My career has enabled me to develop and establish skills in such key areas:
- Data Science, Data Analytics & Perseverance to Learn and Improve.
- Research And Analysis, Administration & Management
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Android & Software Development.

In summary, I am a passionate Machine Learning and Data Science Engineer who is committed to applying technical expertise to solve real-world problems in a collaborative environment.

## Projects

I have worked on Machine Learning Projects such as DFS for Foreclosure rates Mysql Analysis, Forest Fire Prediction, ASL Reader, Urbanization Detection, Sales Forecasting, Android Applications like Lost'N Found, Campus Notify, etc.
